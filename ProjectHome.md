High performance distributed computing exploiting grids allow to efficiently solve computational intensive problems. Mesh partitioning is a technology aimed at better manage the heterogeneity of the grid and hide it form the end user. For purposes of testing, **Wrekagrid** allows to emulate a variety of heterogeneous grids on one homogeneous physical network. The heterogeneity is emulated at three levels: CPU power, network bandwidth and network latency.

**Wrekagrid** is based on http://wrekavoc.gforge.inria.fr/*Wrekavoc*, a software developped at the INRIA Nancy in France.

This project is part of my research as a Master Thesis in Computer Science at the University of New-Brunswick. I'm working with Dr. Eric Aubanel and his [Grid Computing Research Group](http://www.cs.unb.ca/research-groups/gcrg/) at the UNB.
